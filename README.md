## Features

After [installing the workflow](https://www.alfredapp.com/blog/tips-and-tricks/tutorial-importing-and-setting-up-alfred-workflows/) (requires purchasing [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/)), type `mtg ` (with the space), followed by your search:

![Example search for "approach"](docs/screenshot-wo.png)

Optionally, go to the Alfred preferences and add a hotkey:

![Adding a hotkey](docs/hotkey.png)

When invoked, the hotkey will then let you skip the prefix and start searching immediately:

![Example search for cards from set "AKH" with type "god", invoked from the hotkey](docs/screenshot-w.png)
