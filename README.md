## Features

After installing the workflow, type `mtg ` (with the space), followed by your search:

![Example search for "bolt"](docs/screenshot-wo.png)

Optionally, go to the Alfred preferences and add a hotkey:

![Adding a hotkey](docs/hotkey.png)

When invoked, the hotkey will then let you skip the prefix and start searching immediately:

![Example search for "Niv-Mizzet", invoked from the hotkey](docs/screenshot-w.png)
